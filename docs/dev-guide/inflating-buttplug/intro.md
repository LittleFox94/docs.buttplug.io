# Adding to Buttplug

This section covers development on extension to the Buttplug ecosystem, including:

- Adding new devices, protocols, and device communication managers to servers
- Implementing Buttplug clients and servers in new languages
- Proposing and adding new messages to the Buttplug Protocol

Throughout this section, if a specific language or technology is required, it will be called out.
For instance, when implementing new device communication managers or protocols, this will usually
be in the Rust implementation of the library. However, for implementing new clients and servers, this will usually be in whatever language the developer is interested in, so general, technology-agnostic advice will be given.
