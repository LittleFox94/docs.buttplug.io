# Getting Started

:::warning Section not finished (or started)

Unfortunately right now quickstarting Buttplug is... not very quick. I'd like to get a better summary up so developers can get an idea of what they're in for without having to read multiple sections. 

Until then, best you can do is read through the Architecture and Your First Application sections.

To write:

- Introduce Intiface Central
- Go over a basic user flow
- Build simplest application possible
- Guide to which sections to read next
